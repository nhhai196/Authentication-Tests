In this paper we formally prove the correctness of two theorems about
cryptographic protocol analysis by using the Coq proof assistant.  The
theorems are known as the Authentication Tests in the strand space
formalism.  With such tests, we can determine whether certain values
remain secret so we can check whether certain security properties are
achieved by a protocol.  Coq is a formal proof management system. It
provides a formal language to express mathematical assertions,
mechanically checks proofs of these assertions.  Coq works within the
theory of the calculus of inductive constructions, which is a
variation on the calculus of constructions. We first formalize strand
spaces by giving definitions in Coq of the basic notions. Then we
express the two authentication tests and give constructive proofs for
them.
