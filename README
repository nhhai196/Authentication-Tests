First attempts at formalizing strand spaces in Coq.

Certainly needs a lot of work; I'm just learning Coq.

Currently have: basic definitions, and one non-trivial proof: that
ingredients must originate.

Next TODO:  formalize a protocol and prove something.

The file "go" is a script that compiles and makes a pdf.
(You'll have to make it executable)
It currently doesn't print the proofs in the pdf. 
Uncomment the obvious lines in go to print proofs.
