\begin{abstract}
  In a cryptographic protocol, suppose a principal creates and
  transmits a message containing a new value $v$ which later receives
  back in different cryptographic context. We can conclude that some
  principal possessing the relevant key has received and transformed
  the message containing $v$. In many cases, the action of receiving
  and transforming must be done by some regular principal not a
  penetrator. An inference of such argument is an authentication test.
  With such tests, we can determine whether a certain value like a
  nonce remains secret so we can check whether certain security
  properties are  achieved in a cryptographic protocol.
  % 
  In this paper we formally prove the correctness of two
  authentication tests under the strand space formalism approach by
  using the Coq proof assistant. Coq is a formal proof management
  system. It provides a formal language to express mathematical
  assertions, mechanically checks proofs of these assertions. It also
  helps to find proofs and extracts a certified program from
  the constructive proof of its formal specification. Coq works within
  the theory of the calculus of inductive constructions, which is a
  variation on the calculus of constructions. We first formalize
  strand spaces by giving definitions in Coq of the basic notions.
  Then we express the two authentication tests and give constructive
  proofs for them.

	I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, Professor Daniel J. 	     	Dougherty, for his outstanding support through the project. 
	
	Thanks also to Professor Joshua Guttman for his quick feedback whenever 
	I have any questions about strand spaces, and authentication tests.  

	Thanks also to lots of friends, the fact that a week has
	seven days instead of only five as I had always thought, and
	the fact that I own a key to the building so I can work at four
	in the morning whenever I feel like it. That is, all the time.
