\begin{abstract}
In this paper we formally prove the correctness of two theorems about
cryptographic protocol analysis by using the Coq proof assistant.  The
theorems are known as the Authentication Tests in the strand space
formalism.  With such tests, we can determine whether certain values
remain secret so we can check whether certain security properties are
achieved by a protocol.  Coq is a formal proof management system. It
provides a formal language to express mathematical assertions,
mechanically checks proofs of these assertions.  Coq works within the
theory of the calculus of inductive constructions, which is a
variation on the calculus of constructions. We first formalize strand
spaces by giving definitions in Coq of the basic notions. Then we
express the two authentication tests and give constructive proofs for
them.

\end{center}

	I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, Professor Daniel J. 	     	Dougherty, for his outstanding support through the project. 
	
	Thanks also to Professor Joshua Guttman for his quick feedback whenever 
	I have any questions about strand spaces, and authentication tests.  

	Thanks also to lots of friends, the fact that a week has
	seven days instead of only five as I had always thought, and
	the fact that I own a key to the building so I can work at four
	in the morning whenever I feel like it. That is, all the time.
