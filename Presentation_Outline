1. A short introduction to Coq 
  + Genenral information like proof assistant but not automated theorem proving...
  + Give some concrete examples with proof : 
    - how to define a term, a variable, a inductive definition...
    - how to write a proof using basic tatics like intro, auto, simpl...
2. Summary of the formalization of strand spaces 
  Talk about definitions of strand, nodes, strand saces... both in general and in Coq
  - Message algebra
  - Node
  - Strand
  - Strand edges
  - Paths
  - Transformation paths
  ...
3. Authentication Tests
  - Introduction to outgoing and incoming test
  - How to prove them, just the general ideas
  - How these tests achieve security goals?
4. My Contributions
  - Formalize strand spaces in Coq
  - Build a strand library that contains manny basic results of strand spaces
  - Prove authentication tests
5. Conclusion 
6. Future Work
